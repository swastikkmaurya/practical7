Experiment 7: Study of Looping Statements in Python

Aim:

To study and implement different looping statements in Python (while and for loops) to perform repetitive tasks such as printing sequences, calculating factorial, and generating Fibonacci series.

⸻

Theory:

Loops are control flow statements used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is satisfied.

In Python, major types of loops are:
1. While Loop
• Executes a block of code as long as the given condition is true.
• Used when the number of iterations depends on a condition.
  Working of While Loop:
1. The condition is evaluated.
2. If the condition is True, the statements inside the loop are executed.
3. After execution, the condition is checked again.
4. This process continues until the condition becomes False.
5. When the condition becomes False, the control exits the loop.

Loops help reduce redundancy, improve efficiency, and simplify complex repetitive tasks such as mathematical computations and pattern generation.

4. Print a and b
5. Repeat from 3rd term to n
6. Compute c = a + b
7. Print c
8. Update a = b, b = c
9. Stop

⸻

Experiment 5: Sum of First n Natural Numbers
1. Start
2. Input number n
3. Initialize sum = 0, i = 1
4. While i <= n
5. Add i to sum
6. Increment i
7. Display sum

Overall Conclusion

Thus, the experiment was successfully completed. We studied and implemented looping statements in Python using both while and for loops. We learned how loops help in performing repetitive tasks efficiently, such as generating number sequences, computing factorials, finding sums, and producing Fibonacci series. Looping structures make programs shorter, clearer, and more efficient by eliminating repetitive code.
